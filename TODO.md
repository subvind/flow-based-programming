after todo: i will update my code base with the submitted files and run the program ... if there is an error then it will be placed within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md otherwise assume i have updated my requirements.

durring todo: if there is an error within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md then help me solve that otherwise don't worry about it and proceed with the following todo rules.

TODO RULES:
- return a ./src/.js file(s)
- i'd like TypeScript in response to my queries!
- keep logger for debugging
- keep code comments for documentation
